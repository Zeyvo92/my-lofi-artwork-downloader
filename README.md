## Context

I'm used to listening Lofi beats 🎧 on Youtube while I'm coding, it's a kind of music that I appreciate and help me to focus when I need to 👨‍💻.
Recently I discovered a website with a lot of Lofi music but what I liked the most it's the **artwork** 😍 that they use as cover for each music here: https://lofirecords.com/blogs/releases

I find these artworks very cool to use as wallpaper on my laptop or even my phone, so I decided to download them (it's free 🥳)....however I noticed that they have a ton of releases (500+), and if I wanted to download them all manually it would take hours ? days ? YEAAARS ? 😅

So I made this small script which downloads all the images automatically, and without duplicate 🚀, because yes it seems they sometime re-use existing images.

_On January 2022 the script downloads 255 images (~931MB)._

## How to use

- Create a folder named `img` on the same directory of the script
- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Run the script: `node app.js`
- Et voilà !
